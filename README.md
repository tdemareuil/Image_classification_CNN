# Image_classification_CNN

This is the midterm project in my Deep Learning class at Ecole Polytechnique (MSc Data Science, 2019-2020).

You will find in this repository the final report I worked on with a classmate (Tommy Tran). We used the [CIFAR-10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) and the Keras DL library.

Our report includes:
* baseline model for image classification: fully connected neural network
* main model: convolutional neural network, with tuned hyperparameters
* appendix: performance improvement with pre-trained models.
